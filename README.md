            <h2>Welcome to My Research Site</h2>

            <p id="homepage-intro">
                The World Wide Web is one of the most powerful technologies ever created. This site explores 
                how web servers work, the history of the internet, and the difference between static and 
                dynamic servers. Through this research I hope to show how the web grew from a Cold War 
                government project into something that touches almost every part of modern life.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                The web did not appear out of nowhere. It grew out of thousands of years of humans trying to 
                share information faster and more accurately. From oral traditions to writing, from the printing 
                press to telegraph wires, every generation pushed communication further. The World Wide Web 
                is the latest and arguably most impactful step in that process. At the center of the web are 
                web servers, the machines that store and deliver information on demand. This site breaks down 
                how those servers work, compares the two main types, and looks at where this technology is 
                headed in the future.

                <h3>A Brief History</h3>
                <p>
                    Humans have been trying to communicate and share knowledge for thousands of years. 
                    From spoken word to writing systems invented in Mesopotamia, to the printing press 
                    in 9th century China, each step brought us closer to instant and accurate communication. 
                    The internet is just the newest chapter.

                <h3>Why Web Servers Matter</h3>
                <p>
                    Without web servers, there is no internet experience as we know it. 
                    They act like a massive library, storing every website, app, and piece of data 
                    you have ever accessed online. Understanding them is key to understanding 
                    how the modern digital world functions.
